## Legal
By using the Lykos source code you agree to both the License (LICENSE.md) and these terms. By ignoring or failing to follow these terms, you are in breach of the software license.

When hosting a self-hosted version of Lykos, you agree that:

- Your modified source code must be publicly available and linked in the bot somewhere (For example as the response to a command). This means you cannot host the bot as-is, since this version does not link to a source yet.
- Your source repository must link back to the original repository. This is acceptable if done by simply forking the original repository and leaving GitHub's "Forked from" notice intact. Otherwise, a notice and link must be included in the Readme or similar documentation.
- Your bot CANNOT be public. The `Public Bot` checkbox on your Application MUST be unticked.
- You cannot charge for anything in your bot or lock any feature behind "Upvotes" or similar mechanisms. Asking for donations is acceptable, if it does not limit any features.
- You cannot list your bot on any "Bot list" services or otherwise advertise your bot outside of its source repository and word of mouth.
- No support will be given on this repository for modifications of the source code. Issues created from self-hosted versions will only be considered if they can be reproduced in the original code.

In the event that an oversight causes these terms to contradict with the License of this software, the terms will take priority, even if means invalidating the original license.
